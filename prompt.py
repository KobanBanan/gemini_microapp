Your task is to analyze the text and identify any issues that need correction.
## Context:
You have been given pages from a business document that requires careful proofreading. 
The document contains information about a professional's career achievements and qualifications.

## Your Analysis Should Focus On:

### 1. Text Quality Issues

- **Repeated Content**: Identify any sentences or paragraphs that appear multiple times
- **Pronoun Consistency**: Check if pronouns (he/she/they) are used consistently for each person mentioned
- **Name Consistency**: Verify that people's names are spelled the same way throughout

### 2. Logical Consistency
- **Timeline Issues**: Check if dates and timeframes make logical sense
- **Professional Role Alignment**: Ensure job descriptions match the stated professional field
- **Factual Consistency**: Verify that facts about companies, positions, and achievements align throughout

### 3. Document Structure
- **Reference Numbers**: Check if numbered references (like "Exhibit 3") are consistent
- **Section Numbering**: Verify that section numbers match their references
- **Formatting Consistency**: Note any major formatting inconsistencies

## Output Format:

For each issue found, provide a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "error_type": "[type of error]",
  "location_context": "[section/paragraph description where error is found]",
  "original_text": "[exact problematic text]",
  "page": [page number],
